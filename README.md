# prime_factoring_projects

I wasn't going to add this but some friends assured me it does count as a project.
At the very least, this proves I actually know the languages I claim to know on my resume. 
I find this a really good way to start learning a language, because it requires reading input and loops and recursion and stuff.
I love programming, and some project is better than no projects, so here's hoping I get an actual job.

I will close with something the best prof in the world (Bill Bird at the University of Victoria) told me (told the class):
I am a programmer, and I'm going to be an engineer
