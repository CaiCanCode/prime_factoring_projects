# prime_factoring_projects

I wasn't going to add this but some friends assured me it does count as a project.
At the very least, this proves I actually know the languages I claim to know on my resume. 
I find this a really good way to start learning a language, because it requires reading input and loops and recursion and stuff.
I will add more stuff to the C one (there's a comment explaining that I am very lazy), and I'll probably add Python eventually too.
Like I said, I use this to learn languages, so there will be more as I add more as I learn more languages, but I learned Python so long ago I probably lost the file lol
I love programming, and some project is better than no projects, so here's hoping I get an actual job.

I will close with something the best prof in the world (Bill Bird at the University of Victoria) told me (told the class):
I am a programmer, and I'm going to be an engineer
